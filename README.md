# Snake On Steroids
This is a program about the well known snake game. The only difference is, that there is always a chance of a golden apple spawning. When eating it, the snake becomes immortal and can not collide with itself nor the borders. This projects was inspired by and based upon a video on YouTube, provided by @Bro Code. [^1]

## Aditional Features
- Implemented a new feature with golden apples that makes the snake invulnerable.
- Implemented timers for the "color effect" and invulnerability.
- Made it possible to restart the game in the end screen
- Solved collision a bug, which was caused by pressing two keys at once
